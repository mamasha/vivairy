## Here is your first assignment.

- Try to read the introduction and solve three problems from there
  - Run the code (button) to check it
  - Submit the code when it is working
- Your goal is to understand if it is for you
  - Too complex
  - Too easy
  - Doable

- Make an account on this site github.com

  - So I will add you to be a collaborator

Have a nice day.
